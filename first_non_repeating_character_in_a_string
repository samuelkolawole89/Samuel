#FIRST NON REPEATING CHARACTER IN A STRING
#this is a python code that uses hash table in the mode of dictionaries i.e counts = {}
#loop through each character "c" in string "str1"
#if c in counts, its value in dictionary would be increased by 1
#if c not in counts, its value in dictionary becomes 1 and it is appended to character_order list

#loop through character_order list to find the first character whose value in counts is 1
#if found, return the value - c
#else return None

	character_order = []
	counts = {}
	for c in str1:
		if c in counts:
			counts[c] += 1
		else:
			counts[c] = 1
			character_order.append(c)
	for c in character_order:
		if counts[c] == 1:
			return c
